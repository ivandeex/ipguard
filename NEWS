- fedora packaging + minor fix

Usage
- to start blocking,  run 'sudo service moblock start'
- to stop blocking, run 'sudo service moblock stop'

NB:
 No need to mannually update the blocklist, cron does this for you. 

WARNING:
 If moblock process aborted for some reason, EVERY connections would fail
 until you run 'sudo service moblock stop' mannualy.
 As moblock runs in background and thus dies silently in such cases,
 care must be taken if you run moblock as a service (like the above commands).
